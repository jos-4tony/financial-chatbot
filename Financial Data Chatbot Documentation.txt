Average Total Revenue for a Company: Calculates the average total revenue for a specified company across all available years.
Total Revenue Across All Companies: Gives the total revenue aggregated across all companies in the dataset.
Net Income Queries:

Limitations
Data Specificity: Queries are limited to the dataset provided in the Excel file (Book1.xlsx). Queries outside the scope of this dataset will not return meaningful results.
Exact Query Format: Queries need to closely match predefined formats to be processed correctly. Variations in query structure may lead to incorrect or no responses.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented for file loading and data parsing errors. However, more sophisticated error handling for unexpected user inputs or data issues could be added.
Usage
The chatbot is interactive and prompts the user for queries related to financial data. It processes the query based on predefined functions and returns the relevant information.
